# Maze Game with A* Solver

## Overview

The **Maze Game with A* Solver** is a Python-based maze game built using Tkinter. In this game, players navigate through procedurally generated mazes, collect treats, and compete against an A* agent (a pathfinding algorithm). The game provides random maze generation, real-time scoring, and the option to compare the player's performance to the optimal path calculated by the A* algorithm. This project is fun and educational, highlighting key concepts in pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: Each game session generates a new maze.
- **Player vs. A star Agent**: Players navigate the maze while an A* agent finds the optimal path.
- **Treat Collection**: Collect treats scattered in the maze to score points.
- **Optimal Path Comparison**: Compare the player's path to the optimal path found by the A* algorithm.
- **Interactive UI**: A simple graphical user interface built using Tkinter for intuitive gameplay.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points based on how quickly the player navigates the maze and collects treats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
  
## Installation

To install and run the Maze Game with A* Solver:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-game-with-a-solver.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd maze-game-with-a-solver
```

3. Install dependencies (Tkinter is typically included with Python):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python maze_game.py
```

## How to Play

- **Move**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move your character through the maze.
- **Collect Treats**: Try to collect as many treats as possible scattered around the maze.
- **Beat the A* Agent**: The A* agent will be trying to solve the maze and find the optimal pathâ€”try to navigate faster or more efficiently than the agent!

## Code Structure

- **maze_game.py**: Main file where the game logic is implemented. Includes game loop, player movement, and interaction with the A* solver.
- **maze_solver.py**: Contains the A* algorithm implementation used for finding the optimal path.
- **maze_generator.py**: Random maze generation logic that creates new mazes for each game session.
- **player.py**: Logic for player movement and treat collection.
- **ui.py**: Tkinter-based GUI code to create the game's window, buttons, and display elements.
- **assets/**: Folder containing graphical assets used for the game (e.g., player, treats, maze walls).
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies needed to run the game.
